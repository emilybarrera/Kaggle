# Game Data EDA -----------------------------------------------------------
## Eda for basic game data
## aggregating the data i want for this first round of eda. goal is to just understand
##    the data and basic game information

# dim table for players normal non-special teams position

# EDA Concussion ----------------------------------------------------------
## goal here is to get a basic understanding of when concussions happen

### what % of punt plays resulted in a concussion?  
# number of punt playst
# 3273 punts
length(unique(punt_plays$PlayID))

# 35 resulted in concussions

### how many fair catches resulted in concussions?


### how many plays resulted in the concussion of more than 1 player?
